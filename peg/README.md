PEG
===

A simple Parsing Expression Grammar library in Haskell.
(a.k.a. a packrat parser)

Features:
* Strongly typed (without hacks!)
* do-notation for sequencing (like in Parsec)
* Line and column numbers
* Parsers are extensible
* Simple regexes
* No error messages
* Asymptotically fast (while realistically slow)

See PEG/Test.hs for examples.
